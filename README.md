## Conclusions
-60 months term has 25% chances of being charged off whereas 36 months has only 11%, this is more than double the chances of being charged off
-Small businesses has a chance of more than 28% of being charged off, while second highest purpose is renewable energy at 18% of charged off
-State of Nebraska has a charged off percentage of 60% which is more than 5 times the chances in any other state, but this is for a very small number of loans of 5 loans and 3 out of which is charged off
-Verification is not helping as verified people have more chances of being charged off
-Higher the grade of the employee, higher the chances of getting charged off. G is 7 times more probable to be charged off than an A grade
-Having pub records doesn't have a huge implication on the charge off status
-Although we expect charged off to be high in the higher subgrades and grades, we see an anomaly for sub grade F5 where the charge off is higher than even G grade employees
-Delinq 2 years, if it touches 8 then the charged off rate goes as high as 50%
-As % inquiries increases, the charge off chances also increases
-As number of bankruptcies increase, the chances of charge off increases and more than doubles when you -the person is 2 times bankrupt
-Installment of 900-1050, has the highest chances of charge off
-More than 30K loan amounts have a very high charge off hence we should reduce approving high loan amounts
-Higher the interest rates, the charge of is much higher more than 40% compared to 5% in low int rate -groups
-Higher the revolving credit utilized, higher is the charge of chances
-Lower the annual income, higher is the charge off chance
